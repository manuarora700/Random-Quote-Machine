# Random-Quote-Machine
Started learning about APIs and created a Random Quote Machine which takes out Quotes from a particular website and displays it in a box. Used JS, APIs and basic HTML and CSS for styling. Also used the concept of Box Shadows for buttons. The user can also tweet directly from the page itself.
